**Product Image Masking and Generation README**

This project demonstrates how to mask a product image to have a transparent background and generate a new image based on a prompt using a pretrained model for image inpainting.

Usage
Setup Environment
Install Python (recommended version 3.6+)
Install required libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python torch diffusers
Masking Product Image
Place your product image in the input_product/ folder.
Update the shoe_photo_path variable in the script to point to your image (product5.jpg in this example).
Run the Python script mask_product_image.py. This script will create a masked image with a transparent background in the masked/ folder.
Generating New Image
Ensure you have a pretrained model available. In this example, we use the kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-decoder-inpaint model.
Load the initial product image (product5.jpg) and the masked image with a transparent background (imagewit5.png) generated in the previous step.
Update the prompt variable in the script with your desired prompt.
Run the Python script generate_image.py. This script uses the pretrained model to generate a new image based on the prompt and saves it in the output_folder/.
Libraries Used
OpenCV (cv2): Used for image processing tasks such as reading, converting to grayscale, and creating masks.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and array handling, especially in image processing.
PyTorch: Deep learning library used for loading the pretrained model and performing image inpainting.
Diffusers: A library for efficient image inpainting, used here through the AutoPipelineForInpainting class and utility functions.
Additional Notes
For better performance on certain devices, the script enables model CPU offload using the enable_model_cpu_offload() function from the diffusers library.
Make sure to have sufficient disk space and computational resources available, especially when working with large images or complex prompts.
Feel free to experiment with different prompts, models, and image processing techniques to achieve desired results.
